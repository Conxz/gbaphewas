# Global Brain Asymmetry - Phenome Scan Results

- Data of this application was from the paper Biological and Early Life Factors Associated with Global Brain Shape Asymmetry. 
- We used the package PHEnome Scan Analysis Scan (pheWAS), which enables comprehensive phenome scans to be performed across all data fileds in the UK Bioban.
- Links: Scripts on Github [gbaphewas](https://github.com/Conxz/) and application online [gbaphewas](https://conxz.shinyapps.io/gbaphewas/). 
- We would like to acknowledge to [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), and [PHESANT](https://github.com/MRCIEU/PHESANT) packages.

**Interactive Visualization**
- We visualized our results as D3.js graphs using tools included in the PHESANT package.  

**Query Table**
- We corrected for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction, with a significance threshold determined by dividing 0.05 by the number of testes performed (N = 2645), separately for the horizontal and vertical asymmetry measures.
